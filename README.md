## Your Turn

1. Create and move to a new branch called `develop`
2. Add some new git commands to the `README.md`
3. Add, commit, and push the branch with changes to the remote repository.
4. Look at the pull request to identify the difference between the branch and master.
5. Merge the pull request and delete the branch.
6. Change back to your main branch locally, pull the results from the remote to your local, and delete the local `develop` branch.
7. Check the branch is truly removed.

git branch
git add .
git commit -m "ddd"
git push
